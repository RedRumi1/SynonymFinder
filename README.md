# ✍SynonymFinder
A desktop application to easily find synonyms while writing!
*(Updated as of 2/19/2026)*

## ⚙ Technologies
- Python (PyQt5)

## ✨Features
- Input a word and retrieve synonyms based on degree of connection to that word

## 🎢 The Process
As an avid creative writer, an easily accessible (and updated) thesaurus is a neccessary must. Often, I find myself relying on different websites to find the alternative terms I need to capture just the right essence for a story. However, there's three problems with using them:
-  They will provide synonyms of a word, but not based on the correct definition I am using as that time
- They do not have a dark mode making it difficult to use at night
- They interrupt my workflow, since I have to constantly switch tabs between my writing browser applications and said websites

Therefore, having an easy pop-up window I can open to fine the word I need would be a huge relief!
